A simplified interface for the AzerothCore database.

I am creating a visual application for the creation of queries for the AzerothCore project's database.
It won't be for expert user, so, if you are looking for a complete interface, please take a look at Keira2. It is rumored that it will be compatible with AzerothCore soon.

My aim is to make the creation of quest and npc for everyone (experts and newbies).
